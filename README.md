## Lets try to understand Options Market

**A financial instrument dependent on the value of underlying securities such as stocks is referred to as an option. An options contract gives the buyer the choice to buy or sell the underlying asset, depending on the type of contract. Unlike futures, the holder is not obligated to acquire or sell the item if they choose not to.

Each options contract will have an expiration date by which the option holder must exercise their option. The striking price is the stated price of an option. Option contracts are often purchased and sold through online or retail brokers.**

# Binary Options:

## A binary option is a financial exotic option in which the payment is either a defined monetary amount or nothing at all. The two primary types of binary options are cash-or-nothing binary options and asset-or-nothing binary options. The former pays a fixed sum of cash if the option expires in the money, whereas the latter pays the value of the underlying security. They are also known as all-or-nothing options, digital options (more frequent in forex/interest rate markets), and fixed return options (FROs) (on the American Stock Exchange).
